# My Java Projects (0 to Hero)

Welcome to my **"0 to Hero"** Java portfolio! This repository contains a series of projects that showcase my learning journey in Java -- from basic to advanced topics. Each project resides in its own folder, along with relevant documentation and code.

### Overview

This repository is a collection of **100+ Java projects** (and potentially more!), each focusing on different concepts, techniques, and frameworks in Java. The aim is to:

- **Learn by Doing:** Demonstrate incremental growth in programming skills.
- **Explore Various Domains:** From simple console-based applications to web development, microservices, and more.
- **Build a Portfolio:** Showcase each project so that others (including potential collaborators or employers) can see progression and depth.

### Repository Structure

Each project is contained in a separate folder with its own name and number, for example:

```
My_Java_Projects/
├── 01_Hello_World/
│   ├── Main.java
│   ├── README.md
│   └── ...
├── 02_Basic_Calculator/
│   ├── ...
│   └── ...
├── 03_Number_Guessing_Game/
├── 04_...
├── .gitignore
├── README.md  <-- (this file)
└── ...
```

Within each project's folder:

- `Main.java` (or similarly named script) contains the main code.
- `README.md` gives details specific to that project (usage, requirements, etc.).
- Additional files or folders (e.g., dependencies, resources, or submodules) may exist as needed.

### Project List

1. **01_Hello_World**  
   _A simple Java console program that prints 'Hello, World!' and asks for user input._  
2. ...  
   _And so on, progressing towards more advanced topics!_

As I complete each project, I will update this list with a title, summary, and link to the subfolder.
